Let me start by describing a city you might know. It's a busy city full of life, while simultaneously it is filled with pollution, its streets packed with cars and the air thick with fumes from many an engine. This isn't a scary future-it's our present reality.  
  
Every day, millions of people drive around our cities and therefore contribute to the climate crisis that threatens our planet. But what if we could turn this around? What if stopping cars in cities wasn't only good for the environment, but also a way to live healthier, happier, more sustainable?  
  
 - **The Ecological Imperative** Cities are responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with transportation being a major contributor. The emissions from cars and other vehicles not only accelerate climate change but also contribute to air pollution, which affects the health of millions. I’ve seen this firsthand in my own city, where smog often blankets the skyline, and respiratory illnesses are on the rise. A ban on driving within the city would greatly lower these emissions, making air cleaner and helping to reach our climate goals.
- **Personal Experience and Impact** Growing up in a city, I had always traveled by car. But then the environment got the better of me, and when I did research on it, I found biking, using public transport, and even walking more often can replace daily travel. The change was hard but gave good results. I saw that I was causing not only less pollution, but I was living a healthier life, and all these changes could inspire others to accept the idea of a city without cars.
- **Sustainable Urban Mobility Solutions** A driving ban in a city may seem extreme, but it can happen with the right roads and attitude. Places like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have shown this is achievable: think of urban spaces where the bicycle and pedestrian come first. Imagine cities with more parks and gardens, where electric buses, trams, and subways function efficiently, and where active transport by citizens of all ages and abilities is safe and possible without car reliance. These are not utopian visions-these are concrete measures that towns and cities everywhere are already implementing.
- **The Social and Economic Benefits** A city driving ban can have big social and economic advantages, in addition to helping the environment. Research has found that less car traffic can mean fewer traffic accidents, less noise, and more public areas for people to meet. It can also help save money on road repairs and health costs caused by pollution-related health problems. 
  
Also, investing money in public transportation creates jobs and grows the economy in more sustainable areas.  
  
A Call to Action: Youths as Agents of Change We are the youth-actually, we are the ones who have the power to stir this change. It's our future which is being jeopardized, and we should be in the frontline. By supporting driving bans in cities and advocating for sustainable rules of the city, we can have green, friendly, and resilient cities. We must demand new ideas and work with city planners while engaging our communities in this critical talk. Finally, let us remember that the problems we have can be solved. A ban on driving in cities is not only about limiting cars, but it is about thinking of new ways to make our cities better for the future; it is about building cities where the air is clean, the streets are safe, and where everybody will be able to live well with nature. As we finish this conference, I ask all of you to think about what you can do in this change. Let’s join forces to make car-free cities real—something that we, and the generations to come, can be proud of.

_Thank you._
